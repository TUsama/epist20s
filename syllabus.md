Epistemology, or the theory of knowledge, is a central area of philosophy. It addresses foundational questions related to knowledge, justification, and rationality. The main issues we consider in this undergraduate level course are:

1. What can we know?
2. How do we know?
3. How do machines know?
4. What is the general structure of knowledge and justification?



The course contains three modules. In the first module, we will think deeply about the nature of mathematical and empirical knowledge. The emphasis is on the historical development of philosophical ideas that facilitated the emergence of the modern theories of knowledge and rationality. The second module of the course is about the various sources of knowledge. This module incorporates several major empirical theories and key experiments from three branches of cognitive science. The third module of this course introduces the general philosophical theory of knowledge and justification that contemporary philosophers take seriously.
